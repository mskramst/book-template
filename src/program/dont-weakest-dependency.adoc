=== Weakest Dependency

Your project is only as good as your weakest dependency. Check the dependencies you include in your project before including them, look at their:

- license
- contribution activity
- security
- contributors

TIP: Be aware of dependencies you include. It is great not to reinvent the wheel, there are usually a lot of choices available but make sure to do your research on the available libraries.
