=== Big bang project

Don't try to complete the project in a manic weekend, then ignore it for the next year. This is not good for your health nor does it look good for your project from the community's view.

TIP: Try to be consistent and do a little every week. Your thoughts and ideas will be better over time, this will prevent you from wasting time on redoing work when you get a light bulb moment a few days later.
